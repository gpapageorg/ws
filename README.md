# Arduino Home Weather Station
Arduino Home Weather Station With Wireless Secondary Stations 

# Overview
An Arduino inside the house called main station has sensors for temperature, humidity and pressure. There is also an other Arduino outside the house
called secondary station, which has temperature and humidity sensors. Data from the secondary station are sent to the main station.
The main Station gathers both its data and the data from the secondary station, and forwards them to a raspberry pi.

# Features
* Autonomous Secondary Stations
* Support For Multiple Secondary Stations
